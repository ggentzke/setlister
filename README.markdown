### Project Goals:
* Create Band
* Create songs
* Create lists of songs - "setlists"
* Apply constraints to the setlist_items such that coherent and sensible setlists can be **generated**.

### Usage:
1. Checkout the project
2. `rake db:setup` # this loads in seed data for playing around
3. Hack away.
